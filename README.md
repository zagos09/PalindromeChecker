Palindrome Checker

-This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. The goal is to build a palindrome checker that determines whether a given string is a palindrome or not.


Project Overview

-A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. For this project, you will implement a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.


Key Features:

-Removes non-alphanumeric characters.


-Ignores case and spaces.

-Checks if the string reads the same forward and backward.
